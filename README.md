# my-methods

A store of handy little methods I've created to avoid duplicating my code.

Whenever you see a file named 'results.txt', that's a concatenation of all of the functions in the folder into a single .txt file.

it was created by my program 'ConcatTextFiles' which can be found at https://github.com/simonjordan557/ConcatTextFiles
